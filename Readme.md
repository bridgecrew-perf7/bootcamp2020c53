# bootcamp2020c53 - Deploying Serverless Lambda Function And Website Deployment With Cloudfront

## Hello Lambda & Hello Website

## Class Notes: -

There are lot of limitations working with lambda functions, but now with the development with AWS lambda functions are lot easier to use. Lambda functions are basic computing engine of serverless computing, computation is all done in the lambda functions. Lambda functions can be defined as chunk of functionality which runs as single piece of code. Lambda functions in AWS are same as in Netlify with only change that we are creating a stack and deploying it as infrastructure as code. While teating lambda function and api locally it is necessary to have YAML file encoded by utf-8.

For deploying websites/client whihc can be in nay language, we can deploy it to AWS servers so we need three modules fo AWS (cloudfront, s3 and s3 deployemnt). Any thing we need to upload reside in s3, we create a bucket in it, website reside in s3 bucket and we will make bucket as website.
